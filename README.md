# commonmark-java with JPMS

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.aya-prover/commonmark)][maven]

This is a fork of [commonmark-java] with jpms support
(see [this](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java/issues/125#issuecomment-985213623) comment).
The original project is not going to support jpms natively and the other fork is on bintray which is closed,
so I'm creating this new fork and publishing it to maven central.
